<h2>This is Assessment of Fruit Health Analysis using Ai by MobileNet V2 with over 95% accuracy</h2>


<h3>Introduction</h3>

Our project aims to predict the name of a given fruit and its freshness percentage through input images or by granting permission to access the camera.

1.We utilized Keras as the backbone for our project, ensuring robustness in our models.
2.The model was trained on 10,000 images, primarily sourced from Kaggle notebooks.
3.We integrated our application with OpenCV so that users can make real-time predictions by allowing camera access.

<h3>Technologies/Requirements</h3>
Flask 2.3.2 or later
Keras 2.13.1 or later
NumPy 1.24.3 or later
TensorFlow 2.13.0 or later
TensorFlow-Intel 2.13.0 or later


lets give me an example of our UI.
